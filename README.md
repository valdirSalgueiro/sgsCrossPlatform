# Singularity Gear Squad

Defeat hordes of biomechanical aliens in this shmup game.

We are looking for feedback with this release. Currently there is one stage, some enemies and bosses to play with. There is no death for now, so don't worry if you aren't doing very well. 

The stage will keep looping after the last boss is defeated.
